We are applying for **reusable**, **available**, and **replicated** badge.

**Reasons**

We believe, we have documented the artifact in a way that can be easily
reused. In particular, we provide a _demo_ that may be used by anybody
to run on arbitrary inputs (JavaScript files containing comments).
In addition, we make the tool available
as a public GitHub repository. The main results of our paper (Table 1)
has been replicated independently based on our instructions through a docker
image.
